# Startup Landscape in Turkiye

The fun project I started to understand Turkish tech scene how media represents has revealed a lot of interesting points I found worth to share.

-   Acquisition deal sizes are smaller than the late.
-   Turkiye lacks late stage investment culture.
-   Most late stage deals involve foreign investors.

## Motivation

-   Avoiding media for startup news.
-   Retain visualization skills.

## Notes on the work

-   Covers [ 2020 Q1, 2024 Q4 ].
-   Excludes deals with undisclosed details.
-   Based on [212 and KPMG Turkish Startup Investment Reviews](https://212.vc/turkish-startup-investment-reviews/?utm_source=ufukty.com).
-   Work in progress. Iterating over presentation.
-   Codebase is [ufukty/landscape](https://github.com/ufukty/landscape?utm_source=ufukty.com).
-   <a href="mailto:ufukty@gmail.com">Report</a> data-claim disconnect.

## Acclamations

Thanks 212 for allowing me to share my visualizations derived from their reports.

## Reading charts

-   Stages are colored as:  
    <img srcset=".assets/landscape/legend.png 2x, .assets/landscape/legend.png 3x">
-   Earlier years are faded.
-   Shades differ in dark and light mode.
-   Histograms create and hide hills.
-   Best on wide screen.
-   Money is in USD nominal and [log-plotted](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/ecdf-qq.html#skewed-distributions) with bins in \$10K\*log2n.

## Bandwidths

Nice to see, despite seriously long overlapping regions, deal sizes go 15x to early and 18x to late in average.

## Deal sizes by years

## Stakes

The "popular" stake range was %5-%10 until very recently. In the 2024 it became 0%-5%. The change factor is Tübitak Bigg Fund with 100+ investments within just one year.

**Tools**

Used Python to plumb data out of PDFs and Numbers to visualize. See my code on [https://github.com/ufukty/landscape/blob/main/scripts/plumb.py](https://github.com/ufukty/landscape/blob/main/scripts/plumb.py)
