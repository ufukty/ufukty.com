# Startup Landscape in Turkiye

I made those for my own insights and thought others can leverage too. I wanted to focus on SaaS investments at first. Then started with creating histograms for understanding the point where investments concentrate.

Combined with the other observations I made on the actual list of deals:

-   Seed stage shows organic formation with bell-like curve despite constant sized seed programs creating spikes visible in smaller bin sizes.
-   Late stage has "weak" domination on the number of deals in its price range (6th chart) although the overall there are too little data to make any conclusion; compared to two stages sits between.
-   Ticket sizes multiply with 15x going from seed to early and 18x from early to late. Acquisition transaction sizes are smaller than the late stage.
-   Shows startups grow, but funding doesn't.
-   Landscape would look slightly different with adjusting older deals by inflation and dramatically different with different bin sizes.

## Motivation

-   Avoiding media for startup news.
-   Retain visualization skills.

-   Earlier years are faded.
-   Shades differ in dark and light mode.
-   Histograms create and hide hills.
-   Best on wide screen.
-   Money is in USD nominal and [log-plotted](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/ecdf-qq.html#skewed-distributions) with bins in \$10K\*log2n.

## Stakes

The "popular" stake range was %5-%10 until very recently. In the 2024 it became 0%-5%. The change factor is Tübitak Bigg Fund with 100+ investments within just one year.
